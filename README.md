# rollup-plugin-datafile

⚠️⚠️ Probably don't use this, it's, like, pre-alpha. But maybe eventually:

🍣 A Rollup plugin which imports files as inline data URLs or as external files, even if they don't exist until build time.

Use-case of this plugin: 

* You want to import data from a file (binary data, JSON data, string data, whatever)
* That file may or may not exist at build-time (implying it could be generated by another plugin at build-time)
* You want to control whether they're inlined or their own files, both generally and individually

## Requirements

At least rollup@3 in order to build this plugin itself.

## Install

Using npm:

It's on Github only for now, but you can add a Github package to your `package.json` if you're feeling adventurous.

## Usage

Create a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:

```js
import datafile from 'rollup-plugin-datafile';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'output',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [datafile()]
};
```

Then call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).

With an accompanying file `src/index.js`, the local `image.png` file would now be importable as seen below:

```js
import imageFile from "datafile:./image.png?mode=array-buffer";
//                     ^^^^^^^^^
// Importing with this plugin will return a promise, as if from import().
// `mode` controls whether that promise returns a `Blob`, a string, a JSON object, etc.
// (by default it's "blob")
//
// If you don't want to specify this in the source file and would prefer to specify
// this in the plugin's options, use the `include` and `exclude` options

const blob = await imageFile;
```

You can also import from the root of the project:
```js
import imageFile from "datafile:~/src/assets/image.png" assert { mode: "array-buffer" }
```

Finally, if you don't want to prefix everything with `datafile:`, you can use the [standard `include` and `exclude` options](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/pluginutils#include-and-exclude) to manually pull in the files you want.

By default, most things imported via `datafile` are put in a flat `assets` directory with the name of the file. Change this behavior with the `transformFilePath` option (which by default returns `assets/${fileName}`, to be clear).

## Options

These options can be specified per extension, per file, per URL extension, and per import assertion:

* `location`: Can be one of:
    * `"inline"`: The asset is directly embedded in the file, using base64 if necessary (which increases the file size not insubstantially).
    * `"asset"`: The asset is written to the output directory as a separate file (default path is `assets/${filename}`).
    * `"url"`: Same as `"asset"`, but it's just the final, resolved URL (i.e. after naming conflicts) exported synchronously. With this location `"mode"` has no effect.
* `mode`: One of `"text"` | `"json"` | `"blob"` | `"array-buffer"` | `"response"`. The import returns a promise to one of these, unless `"location"` is `"url"`, in which case a string is always returned synchronously.
* `mime`: Only used when `location: "inline"` for base64 (which itself is mostly only useful for `mode: "blob"` anyway).

If you're loading an image to use in an `<img>` (or similar), it's recommended to use [`URL.createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL_static) when `mode: "blob"`.

As mentioned, you can specify options via the file's:
* **extension** (e.g. every `.css` file), 
* **full path** (e.g. the file at `C:/[...]/file.png`)
* **import assertion** ("import this file with these settings")
* **import query param** (also "import this file with these settings")

### Per extension:

`datafile({fileTypes: { ".css": { mode: "text", location: "inline", mime: "text/css" } } })`

### Per full path:
`datafile({ fileOptions: (fullPathToFile) => { if (meetsSomeCondition(fullPathToFile)) { return { location: "inline"; } } } })`

### Per import assertion:
`import image from "datafile:somefile.png" assert { location: "inline" }`

### Per URL search param:
`import image from "datafile:somefile.png?location=inline"`

### Asset file locations
`transformFilePath` controls how any given asset is named in the output directory. See `TransformFilePathInfo` for the information this function is given; it should return a non-absolute, non-relative path that the file will be named. By default, it's `asset/${fileName}`

### Top-level await

The `useTopLevelAwait` setting can be used to allow imports to return their values instead of `Promise`s that can be awaited for those values.

Not currently recommended, as the way Rollup inlines modules means instead of `await`ing as many `Promise`s as possible at once, each `Promise` will be `await`ed individually, one-by-one.

## Synchronization

This plugin reads its files during `buildEnd`, which is as late as `emitAsset` can be called.

If you're importing a file that's created by another plugin during `buildEnd` itself, it may be necessary to tell this plugin to wait until that plugin has finished its `buildEnd`. To do this, within that plugin's runtime, search for this plugin and add a `Promise` to this plugin's `.api.promisesToWaitFor`, which is a `Set<Promise>`.  This plugin won't read any files until all of those `Promise`s resolve.
